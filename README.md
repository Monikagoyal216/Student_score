Title: Student Score Prediction with Linear Regression

Description:
This repository contains a Python code implementation of a student score prediction model using linear regression. The code utilizes supervised machine learning techniques to predict a student's score based on the number of hours they study per day.

The main steps of the code include:

Loading the dataset: The code assumes the availability of a dataset with two columns, 'Hours' representing the number of study hours, and 'Score' representing the corresponding score achieved by each student.

Preparing the data: The code separates the features (study hours) and the target variable (score) from the dataset to facilitate training and testing the machine learning model.

Training the model: A linear regression model is created using the scikit-learn library. The model is trained on the provided dataset to learn the relationship between study hours and scores.

Making predictions: The trained model is used to predict the score for a given number of study hours. In the code, a prediction is made for 9.5 hours of study per day, but this can be modified to make predictions for other values.

Output: The code prints the predicted score based on the provided study hours.

This code serves as a starting point for understanding and implementing a basic regression model in a supervised machine learning scenario. It can be further expanded and enhanced by incorporating more complex algorithms, evaluating model performance, and incorporating additional features.
